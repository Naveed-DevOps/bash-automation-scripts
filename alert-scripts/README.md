To run this Docker failure monitoring script:

1️⃣ Install and configure msmtp with your SMTP credentials.

2️⃣ Create the required files:

/etc/msmtprc → SMTP configuration file

/usr/local/bin/docker_alert.sh → Docker monitoring script

/home/username/smtp_email2.log → Email activity log file

3️⃣ Set appropriate file permissions to ensure secure execution by restricting

access to configuration and log files.

4️⃣ Schedule the script using crontab -e to run at your desired interval (e.g., every 5 minutes).

(The lock and state files under /var/tmp/ are automatically generated by the script at runtime.)

5️⃣ Configure the cooldown interval (COOLDOWN parameter) according to your

operational requirements. This controls when re-alerts for the same container

are permitted, preventing alert fatigue while ensuring continued visibility for

recurring failures. 6️⃣ Verify proper operation by reviewing the log file to confirm the script is

executing successfully and email notifications are being processed without

errors.
